/*
Level 1 – Initial Design & Basic Functions
Implement the core functionality of the task scheduler to manage tasks based on priorities.

ADD(taskID string, priority int):
	Add a new task with a given priority.
	If a task with the same taskID already exists, update its priority.

FETCH() string:
	Retrieve the task with the highest priority.
	If multiple tasks have the same priority, return the lexicographically smallest taskID.
	Remove the fetched task from the scheduler.

REMOVE(taskID string):
	Remove a task with the given taskID from the scheduler.
	If the task does not exist, do nothing.
*/

/*
Level 2 – Data Structures & Data Processing
Enhance the task scheduler to support task execution logs and analytics:

EXECUTE():
Fetch and execute the task with the highest priority.
Log the task execution time (current timestamp) and status (completed).

GET_EXECUTION_LOGS() []map[string]interface{}:
	Return all executed tasks as a list of logs.
	Each log should include:
	taskID
	executionTime
	status

ADD("task1", 5)
ADD("task2", 10)
EXECUTE() -> Executes "task2"
GET_EXECUTION_LOGS() -> [{"taskID": "task2", "executionTime": 1234567890, "status": "completed"}]
*/

/*
Level 3 – Refactoring & Encapsulation
Extend the scheduler to support time-based scheduling and dependency resolution:

SCHEDULE(taskID string, priority int, startTime int):
Add a task that will be available for execution only after startTime.

ADD_DEPENDENCY(taskID string, dependencyID string):
Add a dependency for a task, such that it cannot be executed until the dependent task is completed.

FETCH_DEPENDENCIES(taskID string) []string:
	Return a list of unresolved dependencies for a given taskID.

SCHEDULE("task1", 10, 1234567890)
ADD_DEPENDENCY("task2", "task1")
FETCH_DEPENDENCIES("task2") -> ["task1"]
*/

/*
Level 4 – Extending Design & Functionality
Introduce advanced features like rollback and dynamic scheduling.

ROLLBACK(timestamp int):
Roll back the scheduler to the state it was in at the specified timestamp.
All changes made after that timestamp (task additions, removals, executions) should be undone.

ADJUST_PRIORITY(taskID string, newPriority int):
Dynamically adjust the priority of a task.

PAUSE(taskID string):
Pause a task, preventing it from being fetched or executed.

RESUME(taskID string):
Resume a paused task, making it available for fetching and execution.

ADD("task1", 5)
ADD("task2", 10)
ROLLBACK(1234567800) -> Restores state to before "task2" was added
ADJUST_PRIORITY("task1", 20)
*/

/*
Constraints
Tasks are identified by unique taskID strings (maximum length: 100 characters).
The scheduler supports up to 100,000 tasks concurrently.
Task priorities are integers (1 <= priority <= 1,000).
Dependencies must be acyclic to prevent deadlocks.
