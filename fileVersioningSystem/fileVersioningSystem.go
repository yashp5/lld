package fileversioningsystem

/*
Level 1 – Initial Design & Basic Functions
Implement basic versioning functionality:

SAVE(fileName string, content string):
	Save a new version of the specified file with the given content.
	Automatically assign a version number starting from 1 and increment it for each subsequent save.

GET(fileName string, version int) string:
	Retrieve the content of a specific version of a file.
	If no version is specified, return the content of the latest version.
	If the file or version does not exist, return an error.

LIST_VERSIONS(fileName string) []int:
	Return a list of all version numbers for the specified file.
*/

/*
Level 2 – Data Structures & Data Processing
Enhance the system to support metadata and analytics:

SAVE_WITH_METADATA(fileName string, content string, metadata map[string]string):
	Save a new version of the file along with metadata (e.g., author, timestamp, tags).

GET_METADATA(fileName string, version int) map[string]string:
	Retrieve the metadata for a specific version of the file.

SEARCH_BY_METADATA(key string, value string) []string:
	Return a list of file names that have at least one version with the specified metadata key-value pair.

SAVE_WITH_METADATA("file1", "content1", {"author": "Alice", "tag": "v1"})
SEARCH_BY_METADATA("author", "Alice") -> ["file1"]
*/

/*
Level 3 – Refactoring & Encapsulation
Add advanced functionality for managing versions:

ROLLBACK(fileName string, version int):
	Revert the file to the specified version.
	All newer versions should be marked as inactive but preserved in the system.

DIFF(fileName string, version1 int, version2 int) string:
	Return a textual diff of the content between two specified versions of a file.

DELETE_VERSION(fileName string, version int):
	Permanently delete a specific version of a file.

SAVE("file1", "content1")
SAVE("file1", "content2")
ROLLBACK("file1", 1)
GET("file1") -> "content1"
DIFF("file1", 1, 2) -> "content1 -> content2"
*/

/*
Level 4 – Extending Design & Functionality
Introduce multi-user and access control features:

SET_PERMISSIONS(fileName string, version int, userID string, permission string):
	Set access permissions (e.g., "read", "write") for a specific version of a file for a user.

GET_PERMISSIONS(fileName string, version int) map[string]string:
	Retrieve the access permissions for a specific version of a file.

SHARE(fileName string, version int, userID string):
Share a specific version of a file with another user.

RESTORE(fileName string):
	Restore all inactive versions of a file to an active state.

SET_PERMISSIONS("file1", 1, "user123", "read")
GET_PERMISSIONS("file1", 1) -> {"user123": "read"}
SHARE("file1", 1, "user456")
*/

/*
Constraints
	File names are unique strings with a maximum length of 100 characters.
	Metadata keys and values are strings (key length <= 50, value length <= 200).
	Each file can have up to 1,000 versions.
	Permissions are limited to "read", "write", and "none".
	The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent files.
