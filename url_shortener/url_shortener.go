package urlshortener

/*
Level 1 – Initial Design & Basic Functions
Build a simple URL shortener with basic operations:

SHORTEN_URL(originalURL string) string:
	Generate a unique short URL for the given originalURL.
	Store the mapping between the short URL and the original URL.
	Return the short URL.

EXPAND_URL(shortURL string) string:
	Retrieve the original URL associated with the given shortURL.
	If the short URL does not exist, return "NOT_FOUND".

DELETE_URL(shortURL string):
	Remove the mapping for the given shortURL.
	Ensure that subsequent queries for this shortURL return "NOT_FOUND".
*/

/*
Level 2 – Data Structures & Data Processing
Enhance the URL shortener with additional functionality:

SET_CUSTOM_ALIAS(originalURL string, alias string):
	Allow users to set a custom alias instead of generating a random short URL.
	If the alias already exists, return an error.

GET_STATS(shortURL string) map[string]int:
	Return statistics for the short URL, including:
	Total number of times the short URL was accessed.
	Timestamp of the last access.

BULK_SHORTEN(urls []string) map[string]string:
	Generate short URLs for a batch of original URLs and return a mapping.

SHORTEN_URL("https://example.com")
EXPAND_URL("short.ly/abcd") -> "https://example.com"
SET_CUSTOM_ALIAS("https://example.com", "example")
GET_STATS("short.ly/example") -> {"accessCount": 10, "lastAccess": 1678901234}
*/

/*
Level 3 – Refactoring & Encapsulation
Add advanced features like expiration and handling duplicates:

SHORTEN_WITH_EXPIRATION(originalURL string, ttl int) string:
	Generate a short URL with a time-to-live (TTL) in seconds.
	The short URL should expire and be invalid after the TTL.

CHECK_EXPIRATION(shortURL string) bool:
	Return whether the given shortURL is still valid.

PREVENT_DUPLICATES(originalURL string) string:
	Ensure that the same original URL always maps to the same short URL, even if requested multiple times.

SHORTEN_WITH_EXPIRATION("https://example.com", 3600)
CHECK_EXPIRATION("short.ly/abcd") -> true (if TTL has not elapsed)
PREVENT_DUPLICATES("https://example.com") -> "short.ly/abcd"
*/

/*
Level 4 – Extending Design & Functionality
Introduce scalability and user-specific features:

SHARD_URL(shortURL string) string:
	Use consistent hashing to determine which node in a distributed system stores the mapping.

TRACK_USER_URLS(userID string) []string:
	Track all URLs shortened by a specific user.

GENERATE_SHORT_URL(originalURL string) string:
	Improve the randomness of short URL generation by using cryptographic hashing or base encoding.
*/

/*
Level 5 – Concurrency and High Availability
Refactor the system to handle high traffic and concurrent requests:

HANDLE_CONCURRENCY():
	Use appropriate locking or atomic operations to handle concurrent short URL creation for the same original URL.

DISTRIBUTED_REPLICAS():
	Ensure high availability by replicating URL mappings across multiple nodes.
	Use a leader-election algorithm for consistency.

LOAD_BALANCER():
	Implement a basic load balancer that directs requests to the appropriate server.
*/

/*
Constraints
Short URLs should be 6–8 characters long.
The system should handle up to 1 billion URLs.
TTL values are in seconds and should not exceed 1 year.
Concurrency: The system must handle 10,000 concurrent requests per second.
